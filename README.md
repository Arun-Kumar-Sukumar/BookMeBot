Introduction
Imagine having a natural, human-like conversation with an AI assistant that helps you effortlessly plan your hotel stay. This assistant, BookMeBot, is designed to guide users through the entire booking process, using conversational AI and integrated tools to:

🗓 Ask for check-in, check-out dates, and location
🛏 Check room availability for the selected destination and dates
🧭 Suggest top-rated tourist attractions (via Google Places API)
🎉 Fetch local events happening during the stay (via Ticketmaster API)
🍽 Recommend daily complimentary dishes from a weekly menu (mock RAG)
✅ Confirm the booking and provide a complete summary
About This Project
This notebook is part of the Generative AI Intensive Capstone Project (2025Q1). The goal is to demonstrate how multiple GenAI capabilities can work together in a real-world application — in this case, a smart hotel booking assistant.

BookMeBot is powered by:

LangGraph for building structured conversational workflows
Gemini Pro via LangChain for intelligent dialogue generation
Custom tools and APIs for grounding responses in real-world data
GenAI Capabilities Demonstrated
As required by the capstone, this project incorporates below GenAI features from the given list:

Function Calling: Gemini intelligently decides when to activate tools (like checking room availability or suggesting events) using structured function calls.
Agents: BookMeBot is implemented as a looping, modular agent using LangGraph, where each node represents a specific stage in the conversation flow.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Daily complimentary dishes are suggested based on a simulated weekly menu, demonstrating how external content can be retrieved to inform responses.
Grounding: The assistant integrates real-time data from services like Google Places and Ticketmaster, grounding its responses in live, factual information.
Structured Output / JSON Mode: Gemini outputs structured JSON responses when invoking tools, ensuring reliable and interpretable interactions through LangChain.
Architecture Overview
The assistant is structured as a LangGraph-based flow, where each node represents a stage in the user interaction:

chatbot node: Gemini generates intelligent replies
human node: Captures user input
tools node: Executes tool-based actions (e.g., API calls)
Routing logic:

maybe_exit: Exits the loop when the user types "quit"
maybe_use_tool: Decides if a tool is needed based on Gemini’s response
Additional infrastructure includes:

Secure API key handling via Kaggle Secrets
A modular setup allowing for future integrations like vector databases, multimodal inputs (e.g., photos of rooms or meals), and real-time bookings
Notes
This project can easily be extended to hostel, apartment, or travel planning assistants.
Tools like confirm_booking can later write to a real database.
RAG + VectorDB can be plugged in for multi-modal context (e.g., menu photos, reviews).
